Enhanced Contactless Polling/Protocol is a proprietary extension to the ISO14443 standard developed by Apple.   

It defines a custom data frame that a reader transmits during the polling sequence, giving an end device contextual info about the reader field, allowing it to select an appropriate applet/pass even before any communication starts.

Express mode for almost all* (apart from NFCF and REDACTED) passes is done using ECP. Other features (Gymkit, CarKey setup, VAS, Ignore other iphone NFC field) use ECP as well.

Detailed info will be added here in coming units of time.
