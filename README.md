Enhanced Contactless Polling/Protocol (ECP) is a proprietary extension to the ISO14443 (A/B) standard developed by Apple.   

It defines a custom data frame that a reader transmits during the polling sequence, giving an end device contextual info about the reader field, allowing it to select an appropriate applet even before any communication starts.  

This extension:
- Helps to make sure that end device will only start communication with the reader if it has something useful to do with it, avoiding error beeps and card clashing;
- Increases privacy and security as it allows to prohibit any reader from scanning all available passes on the device in one tap.
- Allows automatic usage of non ISO7816-compliant passes:
  * DESFire in native mode or on card-level instead of app-level;
  * (Theoretically) Passes without application id: Mifare Plus, Ultralight, Classic etc.
- Helps with conflict resolution when there are multiple passes with the same AID:
  * For instance, both Gymkit and ISO18013 use NDEF AID for BLE handover. ECP allows to differentiate between them in advance.


## Use cases


Express mode for most passes (apart from NFC-F and CATHAY) is implemented using ECP. That includes:
- Credit cards (For transit fallback);
- Transit cards;
- Access passes:
  - University;
  - Office badges;
  - Venue (Theme parks).
- Keys:
  - Car;
  - Home;
  - Apartment;
  - Hotel.

Other features use ECP as well:
- Value Added Services (VAS):  
  Allows reader to select the VAS applet and try to get pass in advance (although failing to do so), causing pass to appear on a screen for authentication or under a payment card if one is selected.

  <img src="./assets/VASANDPAY.AFTER.DEMO.webp" alt="![Image showing VAS]" width=200px>
- GymKit:  
  Makes apple watch act as an NDEF tag for BLE handover in order to connect to supported gym equipment.

- CarKey Setup:  
  Tells the device what car brand it is, causing a car key setup popup to appear on a screen.

  </p>

 
- Field ignore:  
  Makes apple devices not react (by react meaning displaying a default payment card) to a field generated by other apple devices.
- AirDrop:
  Replaces field ignore in IOS17 for background reading, used to negotiate an AirDrop session. NameDrop is a special case of AirDrop. Triggers a warp animation.

## Device support


Reader side:
* Can be implemented in software on most devices, provided that a low-level access to NFC hardware is available. In some cases it is required to reimplement parts of the protocol stack in software when doing so.  
  Proof of concept was successfuly tested using PN532, PN5180, ST25R3916(B) chips;
* IOS has special reader APIs that make the device emit specific ECP frames:
  *  NFCVASReaderSession, PaymentCardReaderSession for VAS;
  *  MobileDocumentReaderSession for Identity;
  *  When using other derivatives of NFCReaderSession, device emits Ignore frame so that other apple devices don't react to it.
* Android does not have an API for ECP, although some android-based handheld reader manufacturers have implemented this feature in their software.  
  
Device side:
* Implemented using a customized CRS applet.
* Can be implemented on chipsets that allow reading raw frames in emulation mode even before selection.


## Decision logic


Upon entering a loop, device does not answer to the first polling frame it sees, instead opting to wait and see what other technologies does the field poll for, allowing it to make a fully informed decision on what applet to select later.

When device makes a decision, it is mostly, although not in all cases (excluding keys) signified by a card image appearing along with a spinner.

Even though ECP is sent during the polling loop, device does not answer to it. Instead it responds to a polling frame related to technology of the pass that the device had decided to use.

When device enters the loop initially:
* In case of a full polling loop (A,B,F) it waits through one full iteration before making a decision on what applet to select:  
```
(ENTRY) -> A -> ECP_A -> B -> ECP_B -> F -> (DECISION) -> A -> (RESPONSE)
```

```
A -> ECP_A -> (ENTRY) -> B -> ECP_B -> F -> A -> ECP_A -> (DECISION) -> B -> (RESPONSE)
```


* In case of partial or wierdly-ordered polling loop, behavior is different. For example:

```
(ENTRY) -> A -> ECP_A -> A -> ECP_A -> (DECISION) -> A -> (RESPONSE)
```

```
(ENTRY) -> F -> B -> ECP_B -> A -> F -> B -> (DECISION) -> ECP_B -> A -> (RESPONSE)
```

```
(ENTRY) -> A -> ECP_B -> F -> A -> ECP_B -> (DECISION) -> F -> A -> (RESPONSE)
```

```
(ENTRY) -> F -> F -> F -> (DECISION) -> F -> (RESPONSE)
```

```
(ENTRY) -> A -> A -> A -> (DECISION)
```

```
(ENTRY) -> A -> ECP_A -> F -> A -> ECP_A -> F -> (DECISION) -> A -> (RESPONSE)
```

In conclusion, it seems that if reader is polling for:
* 1 technology, decision is made after third poll, response is given on the fourth;
* 2 technologies, decision is made after the second polling loop, while the response is given on the third.
* 3 technologies, decision is made after the first loop, response is given on the second.

Tests were conducted using very big intervals between polling frames. IRL if polling is faster device might respond after more frames than shown, presumably because of internal processing delay.  

Although not possible during normal operation, if a reader is polling for multiple cards using express mode that use different technology qualifiers for selection, following technology priority will be applied:
1. ECP 
2. NFC-F
3. CATHAY  
  
(BUG) If polling for both ECP and NFC-F, device will display NFC-F card in animation while actually selecting and emulating NFC-A/NFC-B applet. 

(NOTE) In IOS17 new AirDrop frame does not follow the beforementioned rules, as device reacts to it on first iteration in all cases.


## Structure

### Frame format

Each ECP frame consists of a header, version, data part and CRC:

```
     6A         XX        XX...    XX XX
  [Header]  [Version]  [Data (n)]  [CRC]
```
- Header byte has a constant value of (HEX) 6A;
- Version number can be either 1 or 2;
- Data part: Version-dependant;
- CRC (Calculated via ISO14443A/B algorithm, according to the modulation used).

### Data payload

For V1 data consists only of TCI:  
  ```
    XX XX XX
     [TCI]  
  ```
- TCI is a 3 byte long identifier
  

For V2 COMING SOON:  
  ```
    REDACTED
  ```

### TCI

TCI, also referred to as Terminal Capabilities Identifier, is an arbitrary three-byte-long integer that establishes reader field connection to a particular pass type (Home key, Car key, Transit) or system feature (Ignore, GymKit, AirDrop, NameDrop).

There are following limitations of TCI usage:
- Some TCIs are bound to a reader with particular type and subtype (which requires V2), while others trigger for all types (support V1). It is not known if it is a bug or was intentional.  
- TCIs intended for V1 cannot be used with V2.

TCI format is arbitrary apart from several exceptions (related to grouping of similar functionality):
- VAS: grouped with the last integer having a value of 00, 01, 02, 03 depending on mode.
- Transit, Access (Car/Office/Home): first byte is static, other bytes link to particular passes or features.
- CarKey: usually grouped by car manufacturer, consequent values signal readers on front/back doors,charging pad, etc. Can be seen in wallet configuration json hosted at smp-device-content.apple.com.
